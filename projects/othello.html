        <h3><span class="blue">EXPLOIT THE OPPONENT BY LEARNING HIS WEAKNESSES IN OTHELLO</span></h3>
            <p>The project focused on development of an Artificial Intelligence that exploits the opponent by learning his weaknesses in Othello, a competitive two-player game. Monte Carlo Tree Search develops different game tree for each level of the opponent. Instead of applying always the same strategy against every adversary, after estimating their skill level, the algorithm chooses an approach appropriate for that level. The opponent was implemented using minimax algorithm with suitable heuristics. <br>
